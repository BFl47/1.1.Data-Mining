    "\n",
    "Correlation analysis helps in identifying relationships between features and the target variable. However, just because a feature is **highly correlated** does not always mean it is **useful**. Some features might be **redundant, misleading, or unnecessary** for prediction. Here’s how to decide which features to keep:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Considerations for Feature Selection**\n",
    "#### **1️⃣ Remove Highly Correlated Features (Multicollinearity)**\n",
    "- If two features are strongly correlated (e.g., **correlation > 0.8**), one of them is likely redundant.\n",
    "- Keeping both may lead to **overfitting** and **unstable model performance**.\n",
    "- **Solution:** Drop one of the two features or apply dimensionality reduction techniques like **PCA**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2️⃣ Remove Features with No Correlation to the Target**\n",
    "- If a feature has **low or no correlation** with the target, it likely does not contribute to prediction.\n",
    "- Example: A feature that is **randomly distributed** across classes.\n",
    "- **Solution:** Use statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, chi-square) to confirm irrelevance and remove such features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3️⃣ Detect and Remove \"False Predictors\"**\n",
    "- A feature might **appear predictive** but is actually **deterministic** based on domain knowledge.\n",
    "- **Example from Our Scenario:**  \n",
    "  - The feature **“Grape Type = Barbera”** perfectly predicts **Barbera wine**.\n",
    "  - However, this is **a definition, not a useful predictor**—Barbera wine is always made from Barbera grapes.\n",
    "  - If we can **always** rely on having grape type information, **this feature alone is sufficient** to classify Barbera wines.\n",
    "  - **BUT:** If grape type information is sometimes missing, we must **remove this false predictor** and rely on other distinguishing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🛠 Final Decision in Our Scenario: Removing Grape Type Entirely**\n",
    "- Instead of just removing \"Grape Type = Barbera,\" we **remove all entries** from the **Grape Type** column.  \n",
    "- Therefore, we assume that information about the grape type is not accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that our model remains focused on distinguishing **Wine Classes** without relying on misleading or redundant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Best Practices for Feature Selection**\n",
    "✔ **Use correlation analysis** to detect redundant or irrelevant features.  \n",
    "✔ **Apply domain knowledge** to identify false predictors.  \n",
    "✔ **Test feature importance** using statistical tests or feature selection methods.  \n",
    "✔ **Consider feature availability**—keep features that will always be available in real-world applications.  \n",
    "✔ **Reframe the problem when necessary**—if a feature makes classification trivial, reconsider whether certain data points should be included at all.  \n",

    "## Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for **dimensionality reduction** and **feature extraction** by transforming the original dataset into a new coordinate system. In this new system, the axes (called **principal components**) are ordered by the amount of variance they capture from the data. PCA is commonly used to simplify data, reduce noise, and discover patterns by retaining only the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA achieves this transformation by projecting the data onto the **eigenvectors** of the covariance matrix of the data. The **eigenvalues** associated with these eigenvectors tell us how much variance each principal component captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Centering**:\n",
    "   PCA requires the data to be **centered**, which means subtracting the mean of each feature (column) from the data. This ensures that the new axes represent variance correctly. If your original data matrix is $X$, then the centered data matrix is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ X_{\\text{centered}} = X - \\mu $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $\\mu$ is the mean vector of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Covariance Matrix**:\n",
    "   The next step is to compute the **covariance matrix** of the centered data. This matrix represents how the different features vary with respect to each other. For a centered data matrix $X_{\\text{centered}}$, the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n-1} X_{\\text{centered}}^T X_{\\text{centered}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $n$ is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**:\n",
    "   PCA involves finding the **eigenvectors** and **eigenvalues** of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance in the data, and the eigenvalues tell us how much variance is captured along these directions. The eigenvalue equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ \\Sigma \\mathbf{v}_k = \\lambda_k \\mathbf{v}_k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - $\\mathbf{v}_k$ are the **eigenvectors** of $\\Sigma$, which represent the principal component directions.\n",
    "   - $\\lambda_k$ are the **eigenvalues**, which represent the amount of variance captured by each principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The **first eigenvector** $\\mathbf{v}_1$ captures the direction of **maximum variance** in the data, meaning the first principal component captures more variance than any other component. Each successive eigenvector captures the maximum variance that is orthogonal (uncorrelated) to the previous ones. This property allows us to focus on the first few principal components while still retaining most of the important information in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Projection onto the New Axes**:\n",
    "   Once the eigenvectors are found, the original data is projected onto these new directions (principal components). The projection of a data point $\\mathbf{x}_i$ onto an eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_k$ is given by the dot product:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ t_{ik} = \\mathbf{x}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This projection transforms the data into a new coordinate system where the axes are the eigenvectors, and the resulting values are the **principal components**. For the entire dataset $X_{\\text{centered}}$, the transformation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ T = X_{\\text{centered}} V $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - $T$ is the matrix of principal components (transformed data).\n",
    "   - $X_{\\text{centered}}$ is the centered data matrix.\n",
    "   - $V$ is the matrix of eigenvectors (with each column being an eigenvector).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",
    "   PCA is often used for dimensionality reduction. Instead of keeping all the principal components, we can retain only the top $k$ components that capture the most variance (i.e., the ones corresponding to the largest eigenvalues). Since the first eigenvector captures the most variance and the next few eigenvectors capture successively less, retaining only the first $k$ eigenvectors is typically sufficient to preserve most of the data's variance. The reduced representation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ T_k = X_{\\text{centered}} V_k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $V_k$ contains only the first $k$ eigenvectors. This reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of its variance. This step is valid because the first few principal components capture the majority of the variance, meaning the most significant patterns in the data are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors**: Define the directions (principal components) in the new coordinate system.\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues**: Measure the amount of variance captured by each principal component. The larger the eigenvalue, the more important the corresponding principal component.\n",
    "- **Principal Components**: The new variables that result from projecting the original data onto the eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA transforms the data into a new space where each axis (principal component) is ordered by how much variance it captures. By projecting the data onto the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, PCA ensures that the first principal component captures the most variance, the second captures the second most, and so on. Dimensionality reduction is achieved by retaining only the top $k$ principal components, significantly reducing the number of features while retaining most of the information. Since the first few eigenvectors capture the majority of the variance, limiting the transformation to those few components is both computationally efficient and effective for many applications.\n",
